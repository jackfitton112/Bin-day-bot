# Bin Day Bot

![Bin PCB](Images/binpcb.png)

Bin Day bot is a simple bot that will remind you when to put your bins out. On Binday it will glow the colour of the bin you need to put out. It will also remind you the night before.

The PCB is designed to fit into [This model by BrewStew](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3377785). 

Currently it only works on the York City Council waste API but I am working on making it more universal.

## Software

To be added when PCBs arrive.
